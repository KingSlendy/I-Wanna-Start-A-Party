# I Wanna Start A Party

This is the official repository of [I Wanna Start A Party](https://iwannastartaparty.com). Which is an online IWBTG fangame based on Mario Party!


This project makes use of the [GMLive](https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gamemaker-live) extension. But you don't need to have it in order to run the project.
Just make sure to Ctrl+Shift+F to remove ALL instances of the word "LIVE" and you're good to go!
